                <p><span class="lead">Invitation to Take Part</span> We would like to invite you to take part in a research project. This document provides some information to help you decide whether to do so. Please take time to read this information carefully and consider whether you wish to take part. If there is anything that you do not understand, or if you would like more information, please ask us. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="purpose">
                <p><span class="lead">What is the purpose of the study?</span> We are interested in how individuals gather information when making decisions. We intend to investigate this using a computer-based task where you will be provided with information to guess a country in the world. You will be asked to use the information provided to make your best judgement by choosing options using the computer mouse. Our anonymised data recordings are only intended for research purposes and will be not used for other purposes.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="why">
                <p><span class="lead">Why have I been invited?</span> You have been invited to take part in this research because you are aged 18-70, fluent in English, and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. </p>
            </section>
            <section id="withdraw">
                <p><span class="lead">Do I have to take part?</span> No. Please note that participation is voluntary. If you do decide to take part, you may withdraw at any point for any reason before submitting your answers by pressing the closing the browser.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="procedure">
                <p><span class="lead">What will happen to me if I decide to take part?</span> This study should take no more than 60 minutes of your time. No background knowledge is needed. During the task, you will be presented with a series of unknown countries, whereby you will be told the continent of that country. You will then have the opportunity to request information about the country. Your aim will be to identify the country, reporting which potential options you are considering and your confidence in your decision making. You will report how likely each option is, updating your beliefs as you receive more information. You will be told the answers at the end of the session. You will also have the chance to explain your thought process. After the study, we will ask you to fill in questionnaires about your decision making style and personality. </p>

            <section id="risks">
                <p><span class="lead">Are there any possible disadvantages or risks from taking part?</span> The study involves no risks beyond those incurred in everyday work.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="benefits">
                <p><span class="lead">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</span> There are no direct benefits to you but you will be making a contribution to science and our understanding of decision making.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="privacy">
                <p><span class="lead">How will my data be used?</span> We will not collect any data that could directly identify you. Research data (including task performance/questionnaire answers) will be anonymised with a code so that the results could not be linked back to you. All the data are kept on firewall and password- protected computers that are only accessible by the research team. The results of the research may be published in international peer-reviewed scientific journals and may become part of oral presentations at relevant scientific conferences. A copy of my thesis/ dissertation will be deposited both in print and online in the Oxford University Research Archive where it will be publicly available to facilitate its use in future research. Results will be anonymised and stored on the Open Science Framework for other researchers to collaborate and ensure the reproducibility of research conducted. Good scientific research encourages the sharing of information. As such, your anonymised results may be shared with other researchers to be used in other research studies.
